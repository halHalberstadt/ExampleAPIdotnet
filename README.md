# ASP.NET API

This was my attempt to learn how to make a API for .NET using a SQL database to try and learn this new framework and microsoftSQL version of SQL. I am discontnuing work on this particular project as I think I have learned as much as I need to of C#, and there is no workaround for getting the SQL server outside of paying some sum to Azure from what I have tried. I will likely revisit this later to get another version working with a separate database.
